# Invoice Extraction Using LLM and OpenAI
The problem at hand is the inefficiency and error-prone nature of manually extracting invoice data from PDF documents within organizations. This process is time-consuming and often leads to inaccuracies in financial records. Additionally, the increasing volume of invoice data compounds these challenges, necessitating a more streamlined and automated solution for data extraction and structured storage. The lack of a comprehensive system for secure data management has impeded efficient decision-making processes and data retrieval. The project aims to alleviate these issues by automating the data extraction process and providing a reliable solution for data management within organizations dealing with invoice data.

The system architecture in the image is a block diagram. It shows how the AI invoice extraction tool works to extract information from an invoice. The system consists of the following components:
1. Upload module: This module allows the user to upload the invoice file to the system.
Extraction module: This module uses natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to extract the necessary information from the invoice.
2. Output module: This module allows the user to output the extraction results to a CSV file. Retraining module: This module allows the user to retrain the extraction range if the AI tool is not able to extract the information accurately.
The system architecture depicted in the image provides a clear visualization of the AI invoice extraction tool's workflow, which is integral for automating the extraction of critical data from invoices. The four key components of this system work seamlessly together to streamline the entire process.
